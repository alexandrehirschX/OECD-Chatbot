# OECD-Chatbot
A Chatbot For Interacting with SDMX Databases

### Python files :

All the files are commented to explain their role in the algorithm. Some are just utility functions, some others focuses on one specific part of the analysis (find the countries, find the type of question ...). The main file is "analyse.py", using all the other files to realize a full analysis of a given input.

### Data :

In the folder 'data' can be found all the ressources used to test the chatbot (sets of test queries & example queries) as well as metadata dictionaries generated by the algorithm to deal with certain parts of the analysis (topics & dimensions).

### To do before executing the code :

Some third party files have to be added to the repository before running as we are using already trained NLP models at different points in our code. These files have to be put in the folders 'Google Pretrained W2V', 'Stanford_NER' and 'Stanford Parser'. Instructions on how to find these files online are written within these folders.
